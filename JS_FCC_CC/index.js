//*Variable's is JS
//There are three ways to declare variables in Java-Script
//?1: var
//?2: let
//?3: const
//var has global scope. let and const have block scope.
//var variables can re-assign and re-declare
//let variables can re-assign BUT cannot re-declare in the same scope
//const variables cannot re-assign or re-declare in the same scope

//*declaring a variable
//? Make a habit to close Java-Script statements with semi-colom (;)
//let myVariable;

//*declaring and assigning a variable
//? [=] this is an assignment operator
//let myVariable = "i have assigned some value";
