//*Variable's in JS
//There are three ways to declare variables in Java-Script
//?1: var
//?2: let
//?3: const
//var has global scope. let and const have block scope.
//var variables can re-assign and re-declare
//let variables can re-assign BUT cannot re-declare in the same scope
//const variables cannot re-assign or re-declare in the same scope

//*declaring a variable
//? Make a habit to close Java-Script statements with semi-colom (;)
//let myVariable; //use camelCase convention for variables

//*declaring and assigning a variable
//? [=] this is an assignment operator
//let myVariable = "i have assigned some value";

//*Escape Sequence in js
// let myString = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"";
// console.log(myString);

//*double quoted string inside single quotes
//let myString = 'I am "double quoted" string inside \'single quotes\'';

//*string literals in JS
//let myString = `I am "double quoted" string with string literals template`;

//*other escape sequence characters in JS
// var myString = `firstline\n\t\\secondline\nthirdline`;
// console.log(myString);

//*String concatenation
// let myString = `first line. `;
// myString += `\nsecond line`;
// console.log(myString);

//*finding length of a string
// let firstName = "Junaid";
// console.log("length of first name: ", firstName.length);
