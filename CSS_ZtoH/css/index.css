/*! Selectors in CSS
1. Element Selector [h1, h2, p, b, etc.]. Actually they are html tags.
2. Class Selector [.my-class, .header-class, etc]. Using dot(.) to select class's, then style them
3. Id Selector [#my-id, #doc-1, etc]. using hash(#) to select id's, then style them

1. id selector has more power than class and element selector. 
   CSS apply with id selector over-rides other(class && element) selector's CSS
2. class selector has more power than element selector.
3. Element selector has the least power in all selector's

   where (n) is any positive integer.
